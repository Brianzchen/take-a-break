# take-a-break

## About

App for keeping your breaks on track. Don't you hate it you work and work and
work. Then hours later you realise you've been working for hours and you stand
up only to fall flat on your face because you can't feel your legs anymore
from all that sitting.

Now you don't have to deal with that, this app remind you when to take breaks
and better yet you can moderate how long you want the break to last.

Feel free to change the video you want on the fly, the timer will continue to
tick and once the timer ends the video that you've selected will play.

## How to run

Choose a Youtube video of your choice.

Set up the timer choosing how many hours and minutes you want to work for
between breaks.

Press submit or enter on your keyboard and get back to work. You'll be alerted
when it's time to take a break with the audio of your video.
